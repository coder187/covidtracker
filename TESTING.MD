## Testing

### W3C Validators
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

*   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 
    * [Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder187/covidtracker/main/supp/screenie/html_index_validation.png)

*   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder187/covidtracker/main/supp/screenie/CSS_VALIDATION.png)



### Check ALT Tags
I used [SEO CHECKUP](https://seositecheckup.com/) to verify all image alt tags were present.

### Spelling
I used [https://typosaur.us/](https://typosaur.us/) & MS Word to check pages for spelling errors.

### Testing planning.
With this project I have use Test [Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) model (TDD).

The TDD method consists of a cycle of :
* write new test
* implement new feature
* run all tests & repeat all steps until all tests pass.

*1. Disruption to the HSE computer systems caused by the cyber-attack has resulted in some dataset updates being paused until further notice.*   
*2. Note: A CORS issue prevented me from reading the vaccine data directly from the host server so I have copied the vaccine data file locally. I will come back to this to rectify.*        
*3. Note: I have used my own email address as the admin address*  
*4. I have noticed during testing over the past number of days that some of the endpoints can return zero rows of data. This may be due to updates being made to the underlying datas sources*
*I have since added a check for zero rows so that I can update the display accordingly.*

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

#### First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
    * The website title is clearly displayed in top left of the window, and maintains its position on scroll.
    * The index page clearly displays top level stats together with a map of the Republic of Ireland.
2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    * The website navigation bar is displayed at the top of all pages and maintains its position on scroll.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see the latest COVID-19 data for Ireland.
    * Data is updated automatically on page refresh.
4. As a Returning Visitor, I want to signup for the daily update summary.
    * Signup.html allows the user subscribe.

#### Frequent User Goals
5. As a Frequent Visitor, I want to verify where the data is sourced from.
    * Information on data provides can be found in Sources.html  
6. As a Frequent Visitor, I want to see historic data trends.
    * Historical ICU data is displayed on panel to the left of (or above on mobile) the map.
7. As a Frequent Visitor, I want to compare ROI data with other countries of interest.
    * *Not implemented yet.*

### Further Testing
  * I want to further enhance the error trapping while processing the rest services response.
  * Further testing over slow connections.
  * Lighthouse testing shows very poor score for Performance.

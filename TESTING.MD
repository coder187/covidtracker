# Testing

## W3C Validators
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Check ALT Tags
I used [SEO CHECKUP](https://www.seoptimer.com) to verify all image alt tags were present.

## Spelling
I used [https://typosaur.us/](https://typosaur.us/) & MS Word to check pages for spelling errors.

## Testing planning.
With this project I have use Test [Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) model (TDD).

The TDD method consists of a cycle of :
* write new test
* implement new feature
* run all tests & repeat all steps untill all tests pass.
